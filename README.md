# Health-e
This project aims to predict the possibility of common diseases associated with old age in humans through a very user-friendly survey. Additionally, it provides the address and contact number of the doctors in their city for the diseases they have a high probability of suffering from. The database for the doctors is limited to major cities but we intend to expand and update the database.
